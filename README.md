# Market Basket Analysis for Product Bundling and Customer Behavior 
## **Introduction**
The project focusing on analyze customer buying patterns and product bundling through **Market Basket** and **unsupervised machine learning models(Apriori Algorithm)**, demonstrated thorough analysis and unique metrics, addressing feedback to improve our predictive models and dashboards. Our feature engineering process transforms raw data into actionable insights, while our dashboards and market basket analysis provide valuable tools for product recommendations and sales strategies. 

For App development, I created the html by **streamlit**.

## **Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering entails converting raw data into features that are appropriate for machine learning models to comprehend and utilize efficiently. The aim is to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms and integrate them into dashboard development by offering meaningful and pertinent input variables.

In this project, I have developed two tables ***the user_feature_table and order_feature_table*** to extract valuable insights and features.

### ***user_feature_table:***
